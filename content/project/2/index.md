title: Store Sales Forecasting
summary: Analyzed a dataset sourced from a Walmart Kaggle competition to extract insights on store performance and make future sales predictions using advanced time series models like SARIMAX, Prophet, and XGBoost. The Prophet model performed best and incorporated predictive variables such as temperature, fuel price, department and store size. This model achieved an R-Squared score of 0.97 and was able to forecast weekly sales with less than a 6% margin of error.

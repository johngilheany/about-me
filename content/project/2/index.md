title: Store Sales Forecasting
summary: Analyze a dataset sourced from a Walmart Kaggle competition to extract insights on store performance and make future sales predictions using advanced time series models like SARIMAX, Prophet, and XGBoost. The XGBoost model underwent optimization through RandomSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. The Prophet model, incorporating predictive variables such as temperature, fuel price, department, and store size, achieved an R-Squared score of 0.97, forecasting weekly sales with less than a 6% margin of error. A SARIMAX model was also built, utilizing an Auto ARIMA to automatically generate optimal p,q,d values for the ARIMA and Seasonal components.

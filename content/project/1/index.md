title: Detecting Prostate Cancer
summary: Constructed a CNN model to identify prostate cancer in slide images, highlighting cancerous regions. Employed transfer learning techniques on a pretrained ResNet50 model to achieve an 89% accuracy. This project offers pathologists a practical solution with the ability to overlay a probability-weighted cancer mask on a slide image and a user-friendly streamlit app for cancer detection in tissue samples.

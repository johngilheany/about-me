title: Detecting Prostate Cancer
summary: Constructing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify prostate cancer in slide images, focusing on highlighting potentially cancerous regions for pathologists. More than 10,000 images were processed and segmented into 256x256 pixel tiles for improved model readability, before transfer learning techniques were employed using a pretrained ResNet50 model. The resulting model, achieved an 89% accuracy and 81% sensitivity, offering a practical solution with the ability to overlay a probability-weighted cancer mask on a slide image and a user-friendly streamlit app for cancer detection in tissue samples.

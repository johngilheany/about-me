title: Detecting Prostate Cancer
summary: Constructed a CNN model to identify prostate cancer in slide images, focusing on highlighting potentially cancerous regions. Over 10,000 images were processed and tiled, before transfer learning techniques were employed on a pretrained ResNet50 model. The resulting model achieved an 89% accuracy and 81% sensitivity, offering pathologists a practical solution with the ability to overlay a probability-weighted cancer mask on a slide image and a user-friendly streamlit app for cancer detection in tissue samples.
